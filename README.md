# Getting Started

This is going to the website for my blog. Since I seem to always get into a mental mast*rbation about starting projects and never actually finish them, I am going to commit to one stack and build out my blog until completion. I will be adding a blog post once per week.

Tech stack:
- Astro
- Vanilla CSS
- Docker (developing as well)
- Deployed to digital ocean

I could have gone more vanilla than astro and just used vanilla HTML and Javascript but I would like to get some usage with react for future projects, specifically NextJS. On the other end though, I would like to learn basic CSS a little better, which is why I am going with that over Tailwind, which I plan to use in future projects. Docker is also overkill for this blog but I want to follow best practices and learn docker better.

To Do:
- Setup docker compose for development workflow
- Blog header and footer
- Fix logo
- Start blogging
